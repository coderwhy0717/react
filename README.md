# 一· 函数组件 与 类组件的使用

## 1. 高阶组件 表达的意思就是 可以拦截 组件的渲染 需要做出一些事情 比如有的页面需要登录才可以显示页面

## 1.1 什么是高阶组件

```sh
  1.11 把组件当做参数传 就是高阶组件
        或 返回return 一个组件 也是高阶组件

# 二· react 的 styley(css 样式)编写 使用 styled-components 第三方库 (css in js)

### 详情请看 detail—style.js 文件

```sh
  安装 npm install styled-components
```

# 三· 动态添加 className 使用第三方库 classnames

### 详情请看 detail.jsx 文件 第 31 行 通过布尔值 动态添加 className

```sh

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
